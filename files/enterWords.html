    <p>In production the average user would not know about this page because it  gives you, an anonymous person the ability to access the database of this web application. I had to do things this way because I wrote this application to demonstrate my skills and I believe a potential employer testing out my app would want to try out CRUD (CREATE READ UPDATE DELETE) commands. Otherwise, this page should/can only be accessed by the administrator!</p>
